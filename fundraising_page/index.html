        I am a Ukrainian citizen and Iâ€™m raising money for the Ukrainian army where my uncle is currently serving. Although our army has received lots of western help and equipment recently, many individual volunteers like myself are still trying to fill the gaps on a smaller scale. The unit my uncle serves in does not currently have enough thermal sights and drones. Presently I am trying to raise money for thermal vision devices - these are around $2.4k each. They are going be used to make the night watch better prepared for possible attack.
        If you, or someone you know, can help us raise this money you will be helping to protect the Ukrainian soldiers who currently risk their lives to bring victory in this horrible and unjust war.<br />
